# pythonforeverybody

## Goals 
- Complete python for everybody

## Boundaries / Scope 
- My boundaries are based on what i can do with in the course

## Success criteria
- To be able to understand code and be able to make a program on my own

## Constraints 
- No constaints besides time

## Assumptions 
- I believe that i will earn my certificate for Python

## Stakeholders 
- My Professor, and I

## Timelines 
- I hope to earn my certificate within the next month to try and get away from spending an extra $49.99 But i have 12 weeks to officially earn it.
1. Chapter One - Why we Program? (3 hours)
- In chapter one we learned the basics and the main idea of coding as a whole.
2. Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions (3 hours)
- We were taught how to use the python playgorund. we also downloaded and set up the text editor Atom. we learned to also take screenshots on windows but to also download pythona and learned to set up the terminal for python 3 use. 
3. Chapter Three: Conditional Code (3 hours)
- we learned the idea of how coding works. the idea the code that we write is given to the computer and the computer stores the code in the memory and then the computer uses the code and executes the code. and you get your output. 
4. Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration (3 hours)
- learning about syntaxs for contants, variables and constants
5. Chapter Four: Functions (2 hours)
- learning about conditional exicution, the if statements determine the condition to execute.
6. Chapter Seven: Files (3 hours)
- week 6 we learn about storing and reusing code with in your code. this is for being able to name a code and then being able to reuse it just in case you wanna change it or its wrong you dont have to update everything just the file.
7. Chapter Seven: Loops (3 hours)
- in week seven we learned about loops, loops are used for iterating over a set of statements repeatedly, in general terms it is set up to define the iterable, then does this element exist? yes then theres an action and takes the next element but if the answer is no then end loop. their are two differnet kinds of loops, for and while loops.
